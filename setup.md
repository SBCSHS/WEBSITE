# Setting up VSCode and Github

Install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

Visit [GitHub](https://github.com/signup) and make an account.
(If you already have an account, skip this step)

Download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) (unless you are familiar with git or other alternatives).
Note: If you don't want to/canâ€™t install Desktop and/or VS code, you can do everything within the browser, but you may have limited access. I (Basil) am doing it on the browser and have been able to do everything just the same, though keep in mind that things may go wrong.

Sign into GitHub Desktop using your GitHub account.

[Live Sass Compiler]() (recommended)
Allows you to compile sass and scss files to css.
[Markdownlint]() (recommended):
